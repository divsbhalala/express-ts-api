- run the app in development mode, app will be reloaded on file changes

`yarn run start`

- start the app in non-reloadable mode

`yarn run build`

- build the app

`yarn run lint`

- check typescript errors via TSLint

`yarn run lint:fix`

- check and fix typescript errors via TSLint

`yarn run format:lint:fix`

- check and fix typescript errors via TSLint and correct formatting errors via Prettier

### Debugging

If you need to debug some of your code during development, it's very easy. Open following URL in Chrome: `chrome://inspect/#devices`. Click on `Open dedicated DevTools for Node` => DevTools should open. Use `Ctrl + P` shortcut to find the file you need, for example `Common.controller.ts`. After adding a breakpoint the TypeScript file should be opened directly in devtools.

**Note:** If inspect mode does not work for you, you need to configure ports by clicking on `Configure` button in `chrome://inspect/# devices`. The websocket port through which the inspect mode works is displayed during app launch in the command line ("Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/..."). In this example you need to add `localhost:9229` in `Configure` settings.

### API Endpoints params validation

To validate input params sent from API user [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) package is used.

### Production deployment example

Clone the repo on any unix (cloud) server. Make a build of the app:

```
yarn run build
```

Install [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) process manager:

```
yarn add -g pm2
```

Start the app:

```
pm2 start pm2-process.json
```


Test  the app using JEST:

```
npm run test
```

App will be started in daemon mode (background). To check the logs of the app issue following command:

```
pm2 logs nameOfTheAppFromPm2
```

You can find the name of the app in `pm2-process.json` file.
